  <p>Cyberpunk 2077 although known for its rocky launch has proven to be a great game over the years. Created by Mike Pondsmith as a tabletop RPG and years later brought as an open world RPG to mainstream gaming by CDPR, Cyberpunk is the first game ever to make me passionate to create a backstory for my in-game character.</p>

  <p>The world is genuinely alive and beautiful, your character feels like they belong in this vast city. So it encourages you to explore and actually do the “role playing” part of the RPG.</p>
