    <p>In September 2020 me and some friends created a minecraft world in which we played daily and for hours, keeping ps4 on for days on end just so they could play while I slept. As life goes, we eventually stopped playing and over the years we slowly drifted apart, but constantly I kept coming back to this minecraft world, sometimes to continue certain projects left to rot and other times just to remember those quarantine nights.</p>

<p>I came across the video made by Luvstar on minecraft “Forever worlds” a video which described perfectly what I had been doing for many years, coming back to the same minecraft world, not creating a new one but expanding upon the very same one.</p>

<p>Through the years this world file has been copied, backed-up, updated and switched minecraft versions. I hold this deeply in my heart since it contains memories from not only childhood friends that grew with me but also those who grew apart.</p>
